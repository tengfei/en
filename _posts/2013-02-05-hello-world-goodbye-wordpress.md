"Hello world!", this is my first static blog hosted on github.

"Goodbye wordpress!", yep, I quit using wordpress for blogging anymore. 

If you expect me to say something bad about wordpress in this blog, I am sorry
but I am going to disappoint you on this one... Wordpress is like an old and
nice friend to me, we do have a very good relationship since 2008. It's still
improving itself and of course, promising, full of add-ons, numerous themes, you
can probably find anything you want with it. I have gave a shot with minimal
theme and caching strategy like W3 super cache, better but still not fast
enough.

However, for me, I only need speed and information deliverable, that's it.

Like what they say,
> it is the last straw that break the camel's back. 

*Emacs* with
 *markdown-mode* ([How-to](http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/)) is the
 last straw for me, I like the philosophy "One Rules All", I seldom think about
 changing this beast to some other chainsaw IDE, even for something like
 [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) which is a truely beauty, *ESS-mode* is
 still my lover. My only exception so far is the android development in Eclipse
 though I don't like *Eclipse* that much. It's just so fascinating that I can
 use *Emacs* to write my blog and *markdown* together are just a turbo-engine
 limo which speed up my writing and I can just focus on the information I am
 trying to deliver.
 
I saw [Yihui's blog](http://www.yihui.name/en), simply swift and neat, I have to
admit that *github + jekyll + markdown* does win my heart the first time I saw
it. **Simplicity is simply beautiful*. So I just forked his github page and
revise a little bit to make sure I didn't post under his name :p. Just cannot
wait to post my first blog with *Emacs* before I customize my site.

All right, happy blogging 2013!
