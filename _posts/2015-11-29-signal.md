## Introduction

Hi I am Tengfei from Boston, working in a cool Cambridge startup. This
blog is actually a homework from “Introduction to Music Production”
week 2. Instead of shooting a youtube video, I think I might want to
post a blog for the first time.

Now I really want to make some recommendation for music lovers, if you
want to learn some music theory, bing a song writer, make your own
music, Berklee College or Music now have a specialization
[“Modern Musician Specialization” ]([https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modern-musician), composed of three lessons

- “Developing Your Musicianship” by Prof George W. Russell, Jr.
- “Introduction to Music Production” by Prof Loudon Stearns
- “Song Writing” by Prof. Pat Pattison

I live in Boston area, Berklee is always my favorite though I don’t even have an opportunity to be educated there yet, mostly because I am in the health care and computer science industry, music is my hobby but not my job. This online course is great to me that I get more close to Berklee in my life for the first time and I have so much fun study together with people cross the world.

## Gears

Now get back to the topic I am going to write about, signal flow and cables used in home music studio.

Let’s start with what I want to achieve for my own home studio.  The equipments I got so far (some are good starting gear too)

- A [Shure SM57-LC](http://www.amazon.com/Shure-SM57-LC-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B0000AQRST/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1448830962&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=shure+sm57+lc) dynamic microphone ($99)
- A keyboard ($40 from craigslist)
- An acoustic guitar (A present from a friend)
- An electronic guitar [Fender Squier SE](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001R2I12Y/ref=sr_ph?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1448831017&amp;sr=1&amp;keywords=fender) ($199)
- Fender SP-10 Amp (starter kit together with Guitar)
- [Lexicon Alpha](http://www.amazon.com/Lexicon-2-Channel-Desktop-Recording-Studio/dp/B000HVXMNE/ref=sr_1_1?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1448830906&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=lexicon+alpha) ($59)
- Macbook pro with Garageband
- Sennheiser
  [HD555](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FTVDQ?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage)
  for monitroing

Now what I am going to do? I want to build my first music studio with
the gears I got above to achieve the goal

- I want to use Garageband to record instruments and my vocals, use my
  headphone to monitor the sound while I am playing instruments.


## Get started

How to connect them? After go over your gears, I recommended we start
with the audio interface you got and start to draw a signal flow
picture in your mind or on the paper.

### Connect interface to macbook pro 

Let's take a look at the audio interface I got here, a very simple one

![back](http://i.imgur.com/qBpeHxk.jpg)

Let's start from the back, from left to right

- You will see a "Bus-Powered USB" which will be connected to my
macbook via usb to get power from my computer, so this audio interface
doesn't require other power connection.
- Low noise XLR microphone input
- Then you will see two 1/4 TRS balanced or unbalanced line input
- Then two TRS line output
- two RCA line output

![front](http://i.imgur.com/yx1zPL6.jpg)
On the front, from left to right

- Ultra high-z 1/4-inch instrument input for direct to computer
recording. 
- The microphone and line inputs have individual level controls and
peak meters which are summed at the analog-to-digital bus.
- Monitor mix control for balancing an audio source between live input
  and playback mix level while recording. Can be switched to stereo or
  mono.
- 1/8-inch high powered headphone output for use with professional or
  consumer headphones.

The first thing I do is to connect interface with my laptop via a usb
cable. Then turn my mic and line level off so to reduce the noice
before we start testing each input.

Now before we start to connect our gears, let's clearify some concept

- Analog vs Digital
- Two types of analog cable
    - Balanced
    - Unbalanced
- 3 levels of audio signal
    - Mic level (balanced)
    - Instrument level (unbalanced)
	- Line level (balanced)
- Balanced MONO vs Unbalanced STEREO

Familarize your self with those concepts, here is a great
[post](http://ehomerecordingstudio.com/audio-cables-types/)

### Connect microphone to interface

Next let's connect the Shure SM57-LC microphone to the interface, we
are using a balanced XLR cable here. My interface lexicon alpha here
play a microphone preamp role as well to bring the input to the line
level.

### Connect electronic guitar to interface

Two options

- Directly plugin the guitar cable onto my interface fron panel, "instrument input"
- via Amp

### Connect accoustic guitar to interface

I can choose to use

- Shure SM57-LC to record my guitar
- Or I also have an
  [accoustic guitar pickup](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002E3B78/ref=pe_175190_21431760_M3T1_SC_dp_1)
  that canb be directl connected to TS input. 

### Connect headphone to interface

I got a 1/4 to 1/8 adaptor for my headphone to connect it to the interface front panel. 

### Connect my keyboard

Comming soon, I am now trying to figure out how to connect MIDI output
to my interface or computer. Sounds like an option will be a MIDI-USB
cable.
